For seven years I was an academic philosopher working at Deakin University
in Australia and Universit√© catholique de Louvain in Belgium. For the most part,
my research focused on the modelling and explanation of irrational belief-formation.
After I tied up a three year contract in Belgium and came back to Australia I made
a decision to change careers, and now I'm a software developer.
Right now I work at Weploy, a start up whose product
is a web-based platform for contingent hiring.
